This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It copies a lot of ideas and some code from [friends](https://github.com/moose-team/friends), a [hyperlog](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperlog) based chat app. That team has moved on to more interesting things, but I'm starting a step behind so I can learn some of what they learned and then [join them in the future](https://github.com/hypercore-protocol).

But what I really want is a (mostly) serverless chat app I can run on a Raspberry Pi inside my house that works for anyone inside my house using the browser they already have.
